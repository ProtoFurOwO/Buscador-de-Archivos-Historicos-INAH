# Buscador-de-Archivos-Historicos-INAH
A simple and efficient desktop application built with Python and Tkinter to index and search for PDF documents within a nested folder structure. The tool is designed to easily navigate historical archives, assuming a hierarchy of Municipality/Building/Document.pdf

Requirements
Python 3.x
The Tkinter library (usually included in the standard Python installation).

How It Works
The application assumes that the PDF files are organized in a hierarchical folder structure:

Root_Folder
│
└───Municipality_A
│   │
│   └───Building_X
│   │   │   document1.pdf
│   │   │   document2.pdf
│   │
│   └───Building_Y
│       │   document3.pdf
│
└───Municipality_B
    │
    └───Building_Z
        │   document4.pdf
        │   document5.pdf
When you click "Re-Index", the program scans all these folders, extracts the Municipality and Building/Place from the path, and saves this information along with the filename into an inah_documentos.db database.
